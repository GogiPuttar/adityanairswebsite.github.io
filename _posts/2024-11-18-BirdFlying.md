## Overview

<br>

## Personal Motivation

### MetaFly by Bionic Bird

### How hard is it to fly this thing?

<br>

## Control Architecture

## System Design

### Motion Capture - Feedback

### The Closed Loop
Skip to [Control Architecture](#control-architecture) which discusses the various control strategies that work.

<br>

## Experiments

### Screw Trajectory

### Data Collection

<br>

## Future Work

### 1. Reactive Drift Control

### 2. Imitation Learning through Data Collection

### 3. Tuning gains "on the fly"

### 4. Transitioning from one set of constraints to another

### 5. Minimal radius control
