## Overview

I'm currently working as an Autonomous Driving Software Engineer at Aurrigo Intl. where I'm developing an L4 Fully Self Driving truck for lifting and carrying cargo at the Cincinnati International Airport, including the perception stack, behavior architecture and path planner using C++, Python and ROS.

Stay tuned for more updates!
