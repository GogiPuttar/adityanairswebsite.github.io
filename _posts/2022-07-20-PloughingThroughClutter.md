## What problem does this solve?

Traditional PID control for tracking a moving target is inherently unstable on an under-actuated non-holonomic robot such as this one. Ultimately, any obstacles that come in the way can create errors so large, they're impossible to recover from.

## Limit Cycles

My approach instead uses a time-invariant controller based on a non-linear vector field.
