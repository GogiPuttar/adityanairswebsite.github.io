## Overview

This is my implementation of the [Wavefront Planner](https://nu-msr.github.io/hackathon/wavefront.html) maze solving algorithm. 
Here, an Agent is manually moved around an M x N grid maze, and at any point can summon the Oracle to show them the path to the goal.
Further, the entire interface is in a terminal and the walls of the maze are rendered off a bitmap, with unicode.

## Personal Motivation

I completed this project during Northwestern's MS in Robotics Hackathon. 
In a span of two weeks, we undertook various projects involving Randomly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), computer vision, manipulation, path planning, and shell scripting in an extremely fun, gamified environment.

## Conclusion

This project fulfills its intended goal in a very pretty manner.
The reason I have a separate post for this relatively short project is largely because it looks asthetically pleasing.

### This Post is under construction üõ†Ô∏è
Building a perfect portfolio from the ground up is a demanding process.
Over the coming weeks, I will be adding more information about my personal and professional projects. 
If you're interested, please check back on Janurary 31st, 2024.
Your curiosity is greatly appreciated `:)`
