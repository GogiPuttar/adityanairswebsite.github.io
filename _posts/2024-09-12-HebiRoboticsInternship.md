## Overview

I spent the summer of 2024 at Hebi Robotics, Pittsburgh as a **Robotics Software Engineering Intern** and had an absolutlely amazing time. My main responsibilities were:

- **Standardized Multi-API Integration:** Unified example scripts across C++, Python, MATLAB, and ROS2 APIs, improving cross-platform usability and simplifying user transitions.
 - **API Enhancements:** Identified and fixed critical bugs while contributing significant improvements to C++, Python, MATLAB, ROS2, C, and Java APIs.
- **Innovative Examples:** Created visually appealing, functional examples showcasing advanced API features like force control and sensor fusion, along with video tutorials for custom development.
- **Efficient File Management**: Developed a custom file management system that reduced code complexity and improved usability.
- **Automated Repository Sync:** Implemented GitHub Actions to automate synchronization of configuration files across repositories, enhancing workflow efficiency.

I'll go into more detail about my internship experience after finalizing a few things with HEBI, so stay tuned `:)`
