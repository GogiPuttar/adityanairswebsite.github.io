## Overview
This was the Capstone Project for the course: ***ME 449 Robotic Manipulation*** by ***Dr. Kevin Lynch*** at Northwestern University.
In this project, I wrote software that ***plans a trajectory*** for the end-effector of a KUKA youBot mobile manipulator (a mobile base with four mecanum wheels and a 5R robot arm), ***performs odometry*** as the chassis moves, and performs ***feedback control*** to drive the youBot to pick up a block at a specified location, carry it to a desired location, and put it down.

The final output of my software is a comma-separated value (csv) text file generated using a MATLAB script that specifies the configurations of the chassis and the arm, the angles of the four wheels, and the state of the gripper (open or closed) as a function of time. 
This specification of the position-controlled youBot was then tested on the CoppeliaSim simulator.
Here, the ODE physics engine was used to simulate contact dynamics and inertial forces.

**The program takes as input:**

- The initial resting configuration of the cube object (which has a known geometry), represented by a frame attached to the center of the object
- The desired final resting configuration of the cube object
- The actual initial configuration of the youBot.
- The initial configuration $$T_{se}$$ of the reference trajectory for the end-effector frame of the youBot 

**The program's output is:**

- A csv file which, when "played" through the CoppeliaSim scene, drives the youBot to successfully pick up the block and put it down at the desired location.
- A data file containing the 6-vector end-effector error as a function of time
