## Personal Motivation

## Abstract

The great terrain adaptability of legged robots,
their capacity to distribute forces among their legs and potential
to benefit from manipulating objects like carrying sensing
payloads, makes them particularly suited for load carrying applications. In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing
the joint-torques of articulated legged robots while performing
such physically strenuous tasks. We propose an inexpensive
optimization-based strategy designed to achieve arbitrary robot
configurations while minimizing the commanded torques, to
keep them within the physical limits of each actuator. Specifically, by first advancing our understanding of the relationship
between the ***ground reaction forces at the robot‚Äôs feet*** and
***torques in the robot‚Äôs joints***, we are able to pose a simple
***minimax optimization problem*** that can be solved online and
rapidly to yield ***optimized torque commands***. In doing so, our
approach is essentially able to manipulate the ground reaction
forces at the robot‚Äôs feet to increase/decrease internal moments
in the robot‚Äôs body, such that the final torques that must be
commanded by each actuator remains within its limits. We
experimentally validate our approach in static and walking
tests, where a series-elastic hexapod robot carries payloads of
varying weight, and show that our method results in lower
overall torques and lower average individual actuator effort.
