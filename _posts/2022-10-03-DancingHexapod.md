## Overview

$$
\begin{align*}
q(s) &= c_0 + c_1 u + c_2 u^2 + c_3 u^3\\
&= \sum_{k=0}^{3} c_k u^k
\end{align*}

## Personal Motivation

<br> 

## Full $$SE(3)$$ Body Pose Control

Provided sufficient forces, the standing legs of a legged robot can "manipulate" the ground in its body's frame, to any pose within a reachable workspace; thereby allowing body pose control in the ground frame. 

This is my ***complete derivation*** of Body Pose Control in full $$SE(3)$$. 
This can be applied to any standing legged robot / delta platform provided it has sufficient degrees of freedom and reliable IK.
In this case, the $$3$$ standing legs possess $$9$$ degrees of freedom which is greater than $$6$$ required for body pose control (kinematically redundant).
I have also derived an equivalent expression for ***velocity kinematics*** and a ***$$9 \times 6 $$ Body Pose Jacobian*** but I have excluded it here to save space since it was not directly utilized for this project.

Given the world frame $$a$$, the initial body frame (home configuration) $$b$$ and the changed body frame $$c$$. We define the body pose $$[x, y, z, \alpha, \beta. \gamma]^T$$ such that:

$$
T_{bc} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    &  &  & x\\
    & R_z(\gamma)R_y(\beta)R_x(\alpha)& & y\\
    &  &  & z\\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix},
$$

in the standard order, roll ($$\alpha$$) $$\rightarrow$$ pitch ($$\beta$$) $$\rightarrow$$ yaw ($$\gamma$$) in local frames.

Further, the positions of the three standing feet $$p_i: i = \{1,2,3\}$$, in the instantaneous body frame, are what we command to the IK-based controller to change the body pose. 
These feet positions are static in the world frame $$a$$. 
Therefore, changing these achieve a certain body pose amounts to only a simple reference frame shift of these points:

$$
p_{i,C} = T_{bc}^{-1} p_{i,B} : i = \{1, 2, 3\}.
$$

## Animatronic Motion

Trajectory planning for the robot's body and legs in order to make the robot dance cannot be as simple as iteratively commanding target poses to the robot.
In order to make the motion appear organic, I decided to stitch these various target poses in the task space, using the simple Catmull-Rom spline. 
Here, the task space is defined by the $$3+3+6=12$$-dimensional space in which each target pose of the robot lies.

### Catmull-Rom Splines

The Catmull-Rom Spline, originally formulated by Edwin Catmull (Co-Founder of Pixar) and Raphael Rom, is a smooth curve that can be made to pass through certain $$n$$-dimensional points.

The advantages this specific spline possesses over other widely used curves are:

1. Unlike **Bezier Curves**, Catmull-Rom splines actually pass through every point, and do not increase in polynomial order as the number of points increases.

2. Unlike **NURBS**, these splines do not have a complicated iterative formula.

3. Unlike **general Splines**, the points along the original set of points can also make up the control points for this curve.

<figcaption>Fig. 1. Example trajectory of Catmull-Rom Splines</figcaption>
</figure>

To create such a spline we need to extra control points, before the first point and after the last point in the curve.
Within a loop, these could also just be the last and first points respectively.
The parameterization is described as follows:

$$
q(s) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & u & u^2 & u^3\\ 
    \end{bmatrix} 

\begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
    -\tau & 0 & \tau & 0\\
    2\tau & \tau-3 & 3 - 3\tau & -\tau \\
    -\tau & 2 - \tau & \tau - 2 & \tau \\ 
    \end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
    q_{i-2}\\
    q_{i-1}\\
    q_{i}\\
    q_{i+1}\\ 
    \end{bmatrix},
$$

where $$q_i$$ is the $$i$$-th target configuration.
